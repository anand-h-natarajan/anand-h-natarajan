- 👋 Hi, I’m @anand-h-natarajan
- 👨🏻‍🔬 I'm an aspiring theoretical physicist with a Master's degree in Applied Physics (with a focus on Condensed Matter Physics) from Northeastern University.
- ⚡️ I'm interested in a variety of condensed matter physics research areas such as strongly correlated electron systems, and unconventional superconductivity in novel materials. 
- ⚛️ I have experience in the synthesis of thin-films using PVD (sputtering and e-beam evaporation) and CVD, as well as fabrication of MEMS sensors in a cleanroom environment.
- 🔬 I also have experience working with characterization techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), RF characterization.
- 👨🏻‍💻 I am also proficient in programming in Python and C/C++ and have experience with MATLAB, Qiskit, and LabWindows. 
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on physics-related code.
- 📫 You can reach me via my email - ah.natarajan@gmail.com

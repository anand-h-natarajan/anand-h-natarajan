- 👋 Hi, I’m @anand-h-natarajan
- 👨🏻‍🔬 I'm an inquisitive Master's student studying Applied Physics and Engineering, specializing in Microsystems, Materials, and Devices at Northeastern University. 
- ⚡️ I'm interested in the applications of 2D materials in nanoelectronics, spintronics, and integrated photonics. 
- ⚛️ I have experience in fabrication of thin-films using PVD (RF magnetron sputtering) and CVD.
- 🔬 I also have experience working with characterization techniques such as Photoluminescence and Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray reflectivity (XRR), and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX).
- 💡 I am currently doing research in the applications of 2D materials in quantum sensors.
- 👨🏻‍💻 I am also proficient in programming in Python and C/C++ and have experience with MATLAB, Qiskit, and LabWindows but want to get better. 
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on physics-related codes.
- 📫 You can reach me via my email - ah.natarajan@gmail.com
